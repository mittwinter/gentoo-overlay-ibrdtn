**********************************

  Description
  ***********

  IBR DTN is an open source implementation of Delay Tolerant Networks
  (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay-tolerant_networking, for example),
  more precisely the bundle protocol as defined in RFC5050.

  For more information on IBR DTN visit http://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/projects/ibr-dtn/ .

  This repository provides ebuilds for all ibrdtn packages for Gentoo Linux (http://gentoo.org/).

  The ebuilds were tested on ~amd64 arch. If you experience any problems, don't hesitate
  to open an issue at github (https://github.com/mittwinter/gentoo-overlay-ibrdtn/issues).

  Future work

  Dependencies and USE flags may be incomplete and/or may require some more
  work (versions, slots, etc.).
